# Handoff — 2026-05-26, session: accessibility modal dialog semantics

## State of the build

- **⚠️ DEPLOY STATE:** prod `main` now has **everything through devlog 0049**.
  **Devlog 0050 is NEW work on this PR branch** — a Pages-only change
  (no server/packages touches).
- **Live web (bitrunners.app):** clicker, skill tree, SAMM, admin console,
  dialogue editor, room-code join, email/password auth all live (through 0049).
- **Live server (bitrunners.fly.dev):** protocol v1, idle-disconnect, ambient
  NPCs live. **No server change this session.**
- **Active branch:** `claude/peaceful-thompson-BkYUL` (autonomous run branch).
- **CI status:** gates green — `pnpm lint` clean (52 files), `pnpm typecheck`
  8/8, `pnpm build` 5/5.

## What I did this session

**Security pass** (every-run mandatory): clean. No new findings.
Full results in devlog 0050.

**Accessibility: modal dialog semantics (devlog 0050):**

- **All four modal panels** (SAMM, Admin, Profile, Data Scrape) changed from
  `<div role="dialog" aria-modal aria-labelledby>` to native `<dialog open>`.
  Biome 1.9.4 flags the div pattern; native `<dialog>` is the correct element.
  A CSS reset (`dialog.panel { padding: 0; border: none; margin: 0; }`) was
  added to `style.css` to clear browser-default `<dialog>` styles.

- **SAMM quip** — added `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"`. Screen readers
  will now announce the result message after each pull. Bet buttons got
  `aria-label` ("bet N credits") and `aria-pressed`. Pull button got a
  descriptive `aria-label`.

- **Tutorial cards** — changed from `<div role="region">` to native `<section>`
  (satisfies Biome; no CSS change needed).

- **ScrapeMenu nav buttons** — added `aria-pressed` + expanded `aria-label`
  (so "inv" reads as "inventory").

- **Profile panel** — added `aria-labelledby` and converted to `<dialog open>`.

## What's blocking forward progress

- **Browser verification.** The `<dialog open>` change needs a live eyeball:
  open each panel and confirm it still renders correctly. If any panel looks
  wrong (extra padding, border, alignment), tune `dialog.panel` in `style.css`.
- **Owner-side service wiring.** Supabase + Resend + OAuth still pending.
  Follow `docs/setup/SERVICES.md` §1 critical path.
- **Admin phases 3 + 4** gated on server-authoritative economy (p2p-trading-epic
  P1) and live auth.

## What I would do next, in priority order

1. **Owner-side: execute `docs/setup/SERVICES.md` §1 critical path.** Highest leverage.
2. **Live eyeball — verify `<dialog open>` panels.** Each of the four panels
   (SAMM, Admin, Profile, Data Scrape). Expected: identical visual output to
   before (the CSS reset handles it). If wrong: `dialog.panel` in `style.css`.
3. **`<dialog>` → `.showModal()` upgrade.** Gives native focus trapping. Requires:
   - `useRef<HTMLDialogElement>` + `useEffect(() => ref.current?.showModal(), [])`
   - Handle `cancel` event to call `onClose`
   - Remove existing keyboard Escape handlers (browser handles it)
   - Address `::backdrop` pseudo-element vs `.panel-backdrop` div interaction
   This is a medium refactor; defer until the panels are confirmed visually stable.
4. **Two-client live test:** emote sync, seam visibility, smooth movement.
5. **Admin phase 3: user table + grants** — blocked on live auth + server economy.
6. **Admin phase 4: activity stats** — owner Q&A open:
   "Proceed with admin phase 4 session-logging migration schema (no owner action
   needed; just writes a `.sql` file)?" Recommend: yes — it's additive, purely
   a schema draft, and the owner runs it manually. No wiring until auth is live.
7. **Faction-reward Q&A** — unblocks reputation reward curve.
8. **P2P trading epic** — gated on auth + server economy.
9. **Aether snapshot on `onLeave`** — Phase 2 polish; needs Upstash.

## Files touched this session

- `apps/web/src/Samm.tsx` — `<dialog open>`, `aria-live` quip, bet button labels.
- `apps/web/src/AdminConsole.tsx` — `<dialog open>`.
- `apps/web/src/ProfileIcon.tsx` — `<dialog open>`, `aria-labelledby`.
- `apps/web/src/ScrapeMenu.tsx` — `<dialog open>`, nav `aria-pressed`+`aria-label`.
- `apps/web/src/Tutorial.tsx` — `<section aria-label>` (was `<div role="region">`).
- `apps/web/src/style.css` — `dialog.panel` browser-default reset.
- `docs/devlog/0050-accessibility-modal-dialog-semantics.md` — new.
- `.claude/handoff.md` — this file.

## Do NOT do these things

- Don't push to `main` — prod branch; deploys Pages + Fly.
- Don't merge any PR — owner-gated.
- Don't build a passcode-gated diagnostics/tester menu or Stripe setup section (retracted prompt).
- Don't let the clicker mint Tokens (`bit_spekter` has no wallet — lore 003/007).
- Don't edit `docs/lore/_sealed/`.
- Don't hand-edit `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Don't deploy to Fly from shell — GitHub Actions owns deploys.

## Open questions for the owner

- **Panel visual check:** do all four panels (SAMM, Admin, Profile, Data Scrape)
  still render correctly with `<dialog open>`? The CSS reset should handle it.
- **Proceed with `.showModal()` upgrade?** Gives real focus trapping; medium effort.
- **Proceed with admin phase 4 session-logging migration schema?** (no owner infra
  needed; just drafts a `.sql` file). Recommend yes.
- Prior open questions (visual tuning):
  - SAMM glow: too subtle / too harsh? Target: "clearly brighter when nearby."
  - Hold glow (0.5 opacity, 80ms transition): reads as feedback?
  - Auto-scrape pulse (650ms, 0.35→0.7 opacity, 0.95→1.03 scale): clear indicator?
- Two-client emote/seam test results?
